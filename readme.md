# Verifiable Data Registry Specification

Specification to create an open registry with verifiable data stored in it.

Take a look at how to store entities in this
[document](spec/entity-representation.md) and the API endpoints to implement to
create a spec-compliant registry server in this
[document](spec/registry-server-api.md).

This specification for registries does not involve authentication, authorization
or consent. These are all feature to be added using the registry as its data
store.
