# RFC - Electronic Registry Specification

> Proposal for improvements submitted to the
> [Sunbird RC project](https://github.com/sunbird-rc/sunbird-rc-core).

Specification to create an open registry with attestable claims data stored in
it.

- This [document](/spec/entity-representation.md) details out how to store an
  entity in the registry.
- This [document](/spec/registry-server-api.md) lists the API endpoints to
  implement to create a spec-compliant registry server.

This specification for registries does not involve authentication, authorization
or consent. These are all feature to be added using the registry as its data
store.
